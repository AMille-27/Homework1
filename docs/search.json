    "text": "What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\n\nUntil this class, I thought that they were “basically” the same because both statisticians and data scientist work with data. But no, knowing a little more I feel like data scientist are more in front of the consumers meaning they would be the ones to write the reports about the data. Where as statisticians are more in the background, they deal more in the theoretical part of working with the numbers."
